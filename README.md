# cascade-fountain

## Mission
You have been hired by a children's health organizatino to put together a cascading water fountain that holds a plant.  The cascade must have at least **2 levels (not including the pool) OR a PLANT WALL** -- in order to provide more humidity. The setup should not get the surrounding area wet.  The device should be attractive and should allow a person to grow a plant in a pot with earth - without clogging the pumps.

Ideally your product is made from simple parts (electronic pumps are permitted) and will be easy to fix and clean.

## Technologies to Learn / Practice
* **Structures & Static Joints (attaching 2 items to carry weight)** - how structures support heavy objects
* **Flow (Fluids)** - fluids flow and airate (create humidity)
* **Electrical motors & power** - how to control electrical motors
* **Kanban Workflow** -- organize and track ones project progress independently and when asking for help others understand the starting point
* **Incremental Work** -- work in small adjustable units to build a project
* **Web Communication** -- communicating and web technologies

## Tasks

### Create a Kanban
* **Skip this you already have a Kanban folder**
 1. Get a Folder
 2. Put your Organization Name on the Cover
 3. Inside the folder make 6 columns **(Backlog, Next, Doing, Demo, Angles, Done)**
  
* **DO FOR EVERY PROJECT**
 4. Create a post-it for each major area
 5. Put tasks to cross off on each post-it
 6. Put tasks into backlog (except **Create Kanban** - *doing* & **Research** - *next*)

*(**If unsure - see the classroom example**)*

### Research
At the end of this stage you should be able to sketch your idea and have ideas noted that won't be used (please use your idea books).

1. Research 3 examples of types of cascade fountains
2. Research 3 ways to construct (build) a cascading fountain
3. Choose a way to contain the structure
4. Choose a way to place the pump (withoug ungliness)
5. draw a rough sketch of your product (find a place to include your organization logo)
6. **DEMO** show sketch to another group

### Build the Structure

1. Create the structure -- that allows the cascading to be created
2. Create the containers (bowls, troughs, etc) and the pouring mechanism (how the water move to the next location)
3. Attach the containers to the structure
4. **Test** - Be sure the water flows as expected when poured in by hand
5. **Demo** to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Add the pump
Be sure the pump doesn't make a mess (pump too hard)

1. install the pump
2. hide wires, etc
3. tune the pump strenght -- there are a variety of ways to do this - do some reasearch (google)
5. **Demo** to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Finishing Touches
1. Be sure your product is attractive
2. Be sure your product has your logo on it
3. Optionally, include stones, a plant, etc for natural beauty

### Create a Product webpage (in your Organization website)
1. copy the file **cascade-fountain-product.html** into your Organization's website
2. attach a photo or video of your product (& link the image to the page)
3. give a description of your product
4. link this new webpage into your **Products** section of your organiation's homepage **index.html**
5. **Demo** this product page to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Create a Product blog (in your Organization website)
1. copy the file **cascade-fountain-blog.html** into your organization's website
2. write the **Product Fit** description
3. Write the **Acknowledge** section to honor those who helped you
4. Write the **Ideas to go further** section
5. Write the **Technologies Learned** section
6. Link this new blog to the **Blog** section of your organiation's homepage **index.html**
7. **Demo** this product page to other groups and get ideas for adjustments
